- I worked on a project to develop an AI-powered strategy for predicting and reducing customer credit delinquency in financial services. I practiced using GenAI tools like ChatGPT and Google Gemini and built my data analysis, predictive modeling, and responsible AI strategy skills in a real-world context.
- Doing this program confirmed that I really enjoy working on data-driven business problems that combine analytics with practical strategy and I'm excited to apply these skills on a data analytics team at a company like Tata iQ.
